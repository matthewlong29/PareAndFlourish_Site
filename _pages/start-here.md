We’re a three-person team committed to connecting and inspiring young professionals, especially women. It’s the base of everything we do: [bi-weekly advice articles](/#latest-blogs), [Flourish Roundtable events](/events), and [collaborating](/lets-collaborate) with small businesses and bloggers. We do what we do because we wanted a network. A network of strong, supportive women who encourage each other. 

We decided to create our own. A place to meet like-minded women, discuss specific ideas, and create a sense of community. Online and in person, Pare and Flourish wants to be that space for you. 

We’re always looking for the next opportunity, the next collaboration, the next step to inspire people around us. If you want to be part of this story, we want you here. Join P&F on our mission to lift up the women around us, personally and professionally. 

Come flourish with us.

Love,  
Pare and Flourish
