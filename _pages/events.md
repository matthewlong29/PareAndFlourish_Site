## What is a Flourish Roundtable?

### It is:

<ul>
  <li>A structured networking event without the fear of connecting</li>
  <li>A set topic to guide the connection</li>
  <li>A mediator/coach to guide the conversation</li>
</ul>

### It is not:

<ul>
  <li>A giant event where networking consists of small talk</li>
  <li>A comparison of success stories or the longest email signature</li>
  <li>An event that requires you to sell yourself</li>
</ul>

A Flourish Roundtable is a small casual networking event for female professionals. The roundtable is composed of 10 women and up to 2 moderators. The size of these small events allows participants to feel heard and connected. 

### These events are ideal for women who:

<ul>
  <li>Do not like forced small talk</li>
  <li>Want to expand their network</li>
  <li>Want to create lasting relationships with like-minded women</li>
  <li>Want to leave a networking event feeling connected and inspired</li>
</ul>

What should you do to prepare? Nothing. Your moderator will be prepared with a broad topic, that is disclosed beforehand, ready to guide the conversation with follow-up questions and inspiration. All attendees are encouraged to participate and are given a safe environment to do so.

When asked “What was your favorite part of this Flourish Roundtable?” this is what past participants had to say: 

<ul>
  <li>“Getting connected with other women in the area.”</li>
  <li>“I love a structured networking event. The ones where you show up and are forced to rely on your mingling skills are awful and intimidating.”</li>
  <li>“Talking to other women about goals and empowerment, also knowing that we all are working toward something bigger.”</li>
</ul>
