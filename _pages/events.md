**A Flourish Roundtable is a small casual networking event for female professionals.** The roundtable is composed of 10 women and up to 2 moderators. The size of these small events allows participants to feel heard and connected. 

### These events are ideal for women who:

- Do not like forced small talk
- Want to expand their network
- Want to create lasting relationships with like-minded women
- Want to leave a networking event feeling connected and inspired

**What should you do to prepare? Nothing.** Your moderator will be prepared with a broad topic, that is disclosed beforehand, ready to guide the conversation with follow-up questions and inspiration. **All attendees are encouraged to participate and are given a safe environment to do so.**

When asked **“What was your favorite part of this Flourish Roundtable?”** this is what past participants had to say:

>“**Getting connected with other women in the area.**”

>“**I love a structured networking event.** The ones where you show up and are forced to rely on your mingling skills are awful and intimidating.”

>“**Talking to other women about goals and empowerment**, also knowing that we all are working toward something bigger.”
