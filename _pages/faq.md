      <div class="panelOuter faq"><span>What is a Roundtable?</span></div>
      <div class="panelInner">A Flourish Roundtable is a small casual networking event for female professionals. The roundtable is composed of 10 women and up to 2 moderators. The size of these events allows participants to feel heard and connected. Each roundtable is based on a central topic or lesson to help fuel the connection and lead us to a new skill or self-realization. You can learn more on our <a href="/events/">events page</a>!</div>

      <div class="panelOuter faq"><span>How do I become a sponsor/co-host? What do I get as a sponsor?</span></div>
      <div class="panelInner">
        <p>Pare and Flourish is always on the lookout for new individuals and small businesses to partner with. By sponsoring a Flourish Roundtable, you are bringing together women in your area and helping them to “flourish.”</p>
        <p>Your sponsorship makes it possible for women to network in a meaningful way at a low cost, or no cost, to them. By sponsoring you are entitled to an abundance of social media recognition, shout outs at the roundtables, and the opportunity for us to distribute advertising materials you may have.</p>
        <p>Individuals sometimes choose to co-host to promote their business. In the past, we’ve partnered with <a href="https://www.spaceplaceandsoutherngrace.com/">Space, Place & Southern Grace</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/4yogaBG/">4yoga</a>. If you’re interested in getting the word out about your business, or if you have a skill, expertise, or wisdom you’d like to offer to women in your community, <a href="mailto:contact@pareandflourish.com">contact us</a>!</p>
