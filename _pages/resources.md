			<h4>Lean In: Women, Work, and the Will to Lead by Sheryl Sandberg</h4>
			<p>Sheryl Sandberg, COO of Facebook, is an advocate for women in the workplace. Her book, Lean In: Women, Work, and the Will to Lead, will bring to light the gender equality gap that is far from closing. An uplifting eye-opener, this book is just what you need to fuel your motivation. Her message isn’t only for women—Sandberg gives men pointers on how to further gender equality for the working women in their lives. You’ll see this book referenced many times in the blog. We’re in love with its message.</p>

			<h4>The 12 Week Year: Get More Done in 12 Weeks than Others Do in 12 Months by Brian P. Moran and Michael Lennington</h4>
			<p>Achieving goals is an important part of personal and professional development, which is why you’ll see this referenced in several articles. Brian P. Moran and Michael Lennington help you rewire your brain to think about goals differently in their book, The 12 Week Year. We highly recommend its guidance. The authors have also included useful worksheets to plan your own 12-week year and make it work for your goals.</p>

			<h4>Bossypants by Tina Fey</h4>
			<p>In this witty account of her life and career, Fey teaches us important lessons she learned along the way. She’s as funny as she is wise.  We especially love her raw approach to life and her message to not change who you are or what you look like for other people. You’ll love the Fey-isms you learn along the way (e.g. Blorft (adj.) meaning to be completely overwhelmed but proceed as if everything is fine and to react to the stress with the torpor of a possum.)</p>

			<h4>Yes, Please by Amy Poehler</h4>
			<p>The Amy Poehler you know and love really brings her personality here. She opens up to readers about her triumphs over personal and professional boundaries. We couldn’t get enough. Poehler teaches us important lessons like learning as a woman to overcome what you’ve been taught your whole life to be sorry for. Not only to overcome it on your own, but also to not be jealous of what other women achieve. Her mantra “good for her, not for me” will be your go-to the next time you envy another woman instead of rooting for her.</p>
