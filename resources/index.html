            <h4>Lean In: Women, Work, and the Will to Lead</h4>
            <p>Sheryl Sandberg, COO of Facebook, is an advocate for women in the workplace. Her book, Lean In: Women, Work, and the Will to Lead, will bring to light the gender equality gap that is far from closing. An uplifting eye-opener, this book is just what you need to fuel your motivation. Her message isn’t only for women—Sandberg gives men pointers on how to further gender equality for the working women in their lives. You’ll see this book referenced many times in the blog. We’re in love with its message.</p>

            <h4>The 12 Week Year: Get More Done in 12 Weeks than Others Do in 12 Months</h4>
            <p>Achieving goals is an important part of personal and professional development, which is why you’ll see this referenced in several articles. Brian P. Moran and Michael Lennington help you rewire your brain to think about goals differently in their book, The 12 Week Year. We highly recommend its guidance. The authors have also included useful worksheets to plan your own 12-week year and make it work for your goals.</p>
