Joining a board of directors is a resume builder with a big impact. You're developing professionally and giving back to your community in one fell swoop. 

There are plenty of boards out there looking for bright eyed, bushy tailed people to join their cause.

 But, how do you know which one to go for?

You could arbitrarily choose, but rarely do arbitrary choices lead to good outcomes. 

First and foremost, make sure that you are joining a board for the right reasons. While it can definitely boost your resume, never join a board for resume building alone. 

A position on a board is a big responsibility. Unlike any other volunteer work, you will be tasked with duties that fall outside of your comfort zone—chairing events, asking for sponsorship, making decisions that impact the future of the organization.

Here are three things that we think you should consider:

## Choose a Cause that You’re Interested/Invested In

Find a cause you’re passionate about. Passionate directors make for a better board and better overall outcomes for your organization. You want a “why” to keep your motivation going full speed ahead, as much as possible. Finding your “why” keeps you in check. 

Uninvested board members don’t push for change, and the organization stands still. 

You’re not that person. You’re full of passion and ready to make a difference.

## Choose a Working Board vs. a Governing Board

Consider how involved you want to be, and how much time you have to devote. 

If you have an already hectic schedule, a governing board is often a lesser time commitment. A working board is more heavily involved in helping the executive director with the heavy lifting. 

Both have pros and cons, so refer back to your time commitment. Talk to people already sitting on the board you’re looking at joining. How much time to they devote per week? Per month? 

Both your mental health and this organization’s board deserve your attention. Make sure you can make a strong commitment to both. If you don’t have the time, you don’t have the time. Try not to stretch too far to make it all work.

## Choose a Board With a Growth Plan

Nonprofits can be full of passionate people with good intentions. 

With that said, finding a board with an intentional growth plan can be challenging. In our experience, a board of directors is composed of a variety of professions, with various goals, and limited time. 

Choosing a board that is intentional in how their time is spent can be beneficial to your sanity. 

An alternative to this, for all of you go-getters, is to choose a passionate board that may need direction and help them set goals!
