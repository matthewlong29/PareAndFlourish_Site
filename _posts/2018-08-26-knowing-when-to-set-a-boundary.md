We’re often out to prove ourselves. At the beginning of a new job, a new project, a new idea. Or maybe, you’re a classic overachiever. Whatever the case, we as humans, and especially as women, gloss over our boundaries. 

Do they exist? Sure. Do you put your foot down and make your boundaries clear to yourself, coworkers, and clients? We hope so.   

If you do, here a few steps to remind you to keep those boundaries firm. If you don’t, here’s a great place to start.

## Use Time Blocks

The easiest boundary is time, your most valuable resource. It’s easy for us to discount the value of our time because, at times, it seems like one of the few things in life that’s free. All free things have value, though. 

Try this: 

1. Set aside a period of time in the morning to acclimate to work. Make yourself a tea. Browse emails. Gather your notes. Write a (realistic) to-do list.
2. Eat lunch away from your desk! Even if it’s in the building, give yourself that midday period to relax your brain and prepare yourself for the rest of the day.
3. Set aside the same period at the end of the day. Maybe it’s just 30 minutes, but as you gave yourself time to acclimate, give yourself time to close down. Organizing tomorrow’s priorities. Checking last minute details. Reflecting on your day.

## Think Before Answering

A woman on a mission to get things done is a force to be reckoned with. While that’s true, she’s also likely to agree to something before checking internal boundaries. Not everything has to be done right now. Small emails that have a clear answer, sure, go ahead and send a quick response. 

So, what qualifies as a “boundary pusher”? When should you respond with “no” or “not right now”?

Anything that takes more than five minutes of your time. Time’s becoming a theme, huh? 

We’re not suggesting that you become a bad employee or don’t do your work. We are suggesting, however, that you think of yourself before you answer questions like “Can you get in touch with Tiffany about that project?” “I need you to start on the mailing list for the upcoming event. Can you do that?” 

Of course you can do either of those things. But, remember that list you made this morning? Great. Check to see if this new request fits into your day. 

If not, respond with “Sure. I’ll make that my first priority tomorrow,” or “Great. I can do that around 1pm tomorrow. Does that work for you?” This way, you have time to work it into tomorrow’s list. You can use some of your wind-down time to think about your course of action tomorrow and how your new task fits. 

The main lesson here is to pause. Rarely should you respond with “Yes! I’ll do that now.”

## Embrace Selfishness

You can work yourself to death, if you so choose. It’s not a good way to go, for reasons that are beyond obvious. If you need a logical explanation, though, here it is: 

  You are not breathing just so you can work. You are selling pieces of your time to an organization. You’ll use that time wisely and do your best possible job. That does not mean you should let it bleed into, or consume, your personal life. 

  You are entitled to living a happy, fulfilled life. Your work can be a part of that, but as with anything, balance is key. You’re not being selfish, you’re preserving your contentment. By not burning the midnight oil, you’re not doing a bad job. Instead, you’re ensuring you give them your good side; the side that’s awake, organized, ready to work, and productive. 

  As for that midnight oil, use that for your passions: read, dream, plan, create.
