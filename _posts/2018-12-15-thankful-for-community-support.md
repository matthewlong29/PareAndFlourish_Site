## A Flourishing Females Event Recap

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-sm-8">
    <p>We’re enveloped in the height of the holiday season, reminiscing about our inaugural <a href="/events/">Flourishing Females Panel + Workshop</a>. As with anything, it has taken time to reflect on the event—how we can make it better, what we loved, who to involve next time. Now that we have that perspective, we are truly happy with how it went. In case you weren’t able to make it, we want to tell you all about it and a little about us. Maybe we’ll see you next time!</p>

Pare and Flourish has been in business, in some form or another, for two years. [Flourish Roundtables](/roundtables/) have been a part of our mission for more than a year. Roundtables are small networking events, 10 women or less, where we connect in a meaningful way over discussion, reflection, and hands-on activities. 

We created this Panel + Workshop as a way to expand our reach, and include a wider point of view from our panelists in their respective industries. Without knowing what shape it would take, we started putting together a panel, planning a workshop, and connecting everything in between.

## Sponsors

First, thank you to our sponsors and collaborators. This event was made possible, and perfect, by our community. Whether it was donations or time—we appreciate it all. Here is a quick rundown of who helped us out:

- [Little Fox Bakery](https://www.facebook.com/littlefoxbakes/)
- [Sarah Gust](https://www.facebook.com/sarah.gust.5) & Kent Brown
- Sara Volpi
- Michelle Darnall - [Beetbox Produce](https://www.facebook.com/beetboxmarket/)
- Blake Layne - [Preservation Tasting Room and Bottle Shop](https://www.facebook.com/preservationbg/)
- Jules Neely - [Jules with the Flowers](https://www.facebook.com/juleswiththeflowers/)

We were overwhelmed with the number of people who were willing to jump in and make this happen. It confirmed something we already knew about Bowling Green: everyone wants to see each other succeed.

## Panel 

This panel was created with one idea in mind: sharing the secrets to success from some of Bowling Green’s most successful women. Our panelists were (left to right):


- Allison Millet - [Bowling Green Backyard Bootcamp](https://www.facebook.com/bgbackyardbootcamp/)
- Michelle Darnall - [Beetbox Produce](https://www.facebook.com/beetboxmarket/)
- Mary Duke - [My Sunshine Birth Services](https://www.facebook.com/MySunshineBirth)
- Teresa Christmas - [Art Matters](https://www.facebook.com/CommunityArtGallery/)

We started the with the obvious questions: who are you?, what do you do?, and how did you get where you are? We wanted to share with other women that isn’t always easy, and it isn’t always perfect. 

We moved into questions about sustaining your business for the long term. One common theme was “showing up.” Whether showing up for their clients, their employees, or the community, every panelist touched on the importance of saying yes and being there. 

Our panelists were all so insightful, and shared some hard truths about being a female entrepreneur. It was touching to listen to them share their challenges. In spite of challenges, they all encouraged the women in the audience to get started or persevere—because it’s all worth it.

## Workshop

We concluded the event with a workshop on Taking Action. This workshop was intended to encourage attendees to dream big, and then help them to plan the small steps that would set them on the right path.

We asked the attendees to share their long-term goals and then helped them make connections with other women in the audience. We encouraged them to utilize their current network, to set coffee dates, and send emails to push them one step closer to their goals. 

The best part: it worked! As we hit a stride in the workshop, women were chiming in and helping each other create their action plans; they even offered their own time and services to help each other get there.
