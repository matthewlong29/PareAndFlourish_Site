## Thanksgiving is Over. Now What?
It’s Monday. You spent all of your “vacation” time driving out of town to listen to your grandparents talk about politics you don’t agree with. Your pants don’t quite fit the way they did before. And now, you’re back at work, wondering where the time went. While you’re battling feelings of exhaustion, it’s easy to be resentful and tough to be thankful.   


In the spirit of the holidays, here are a few mindfulness practices to get you back to a positive place. Because, you know, you’ll be doing all of this over again in a few short weeks.

### 1. Say 'thank you'
So many people helped to make your Thanksgiving great. Whether it was a large gathering or an intimate dinner, there were a lot of moving parts. 


Reflect on your weekend and thank someone. No matter how small the gesture, let them know their thoughtfulness didn’t go unnoticed.

### 2. Reflect
At the end of a holiday weekend, people often say things like “it’s all a blur now.” The constant excitement is overwhelming. These are the memories you want to keep, and that's just not going to happen if you don’t stop to soak it in. 


Write your best moments in a journal or print out copies of photos to put in an album; you’ll want to relive those memories when you need them the most.

### 3. Ease into Christmas, don’t run
Black Friday is intense. It’s as though America is taking a running start toward the Christmas spirit, while completely ignoring the spirit altogether. Plan your gifts slowly and thoughtfully, decorate your house, light cinnamon candles, and really ease into what Christmas means to you. 


It will get here. Promise. Cherish the time you have in between. Don’t spend it all at the mall or shopping online. Everything will fall into place.

In a holiday all about ‘giving thanks’ we so often forget to actually be thankful. Tweet @pareandflourish and tell us what you’ve done to be mindful this holiday season. Look for our next post on ideas for mindful gift giving!
