## I was an English major and I’m not a teacher

The framed diploma on my wall sometimes feels like a scarlet letter.

Don’t get me wrong; I am incredibly proud of earning a Bachelor of Arts in English. I love
reading and writing, so pursuing this degree made sense for me. But I’m also aware of the
stigma that surrounds the English degree in our modern society.

For example, John Mulaney — a comedian, former writer for Saturday Night Live, and English
major — berates the degree in his most recent standup special, joking that he got a degree in “a
language he already speaks.”

I am no stranger to the negative assumptions and general misunderstanding. I’ve had friends,
neighbors, and strangers question what I intended to do with my English degree. Even an
embittered Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond employee once flippantly wished me “good luck” in my future
endeavors after learning that I was an English major.

## Fighting the Stigma

There is a myth that an English degree is a blueprint for two career paths: degree holders must
choose between becoming a teacher (which, due to systemic issues, likely means not earning
much money), or they fall into a loose category called “starving artist.”

Unfortunately, my summers as a camp counselor soured the idea of molding young minds, so
teaching never made it my career short list. And I’m a big foodie, so starving wasn’t going to
work either.

If you hold a degree in English, the arts, the classics, philosophy and the like, you are probably
laughing along with me right now.

We get a lot of flack, but the truth is that the type of degree you hold does not define you as an
employee and doesn’t have to pigeonhole you into a particular field.

I would argue that the English degree in particular translates easily into a professional career,
and can be very lucrative. Let me explain.

I was an English major at a liberal arts college, with minors in creative writing and studio art. As
I neared graduation, I was nervous to apply to a professional job because I feared my degree
was limiting. I had an interest in the field of marketing after completing a few communications
internships, so my parents encouraged me to apply for a post-grad internship rather than a long-
term position in order to build up more marketing experience. A family friend was hiring a
summer marketing intern at a healthcare company, so I decided to apply.

In the interview for the position, the employer asked me about my major and if I had taken any
classes that related to marketing. I explained that these types of classes weren’t offered at my
school, but my mix of English, economics, psychology, and sociology classes collectively taught me a lot about consumers, audiences, how people think, and how to appeal to them (after all,
that’s really what marketing is all about). I also explained that I had picked up skills from a
variety of jobs throughout high school and college that would translate well in a professional
office environment, like money management, sales, and communication strategies.
I have no idea if these were the answers they had looked for, but I landed the gig. After a couple
of months, the internship turned into a full-time position with the company. And within four years,
I was promoted two more times, ultimately becoming the sole (and youngest) marketing
manager for the company’s two foundations that raise nearly \$20 million annually.

By no means do I say this to brag; the job was incredibly challenging, and I stumbled quite a bit
along the way.

Instead, I say this because I want you to know that your degree does not have to define you or
your career trajectory.

I did not have a marketing degree, but I had a strong work ethic and desire to learn. And I did
learn — a lot. But more importantly, any time there was an opportunity like a large project,
review, or promotion, I leveraged my most desirable skills — skills that I gained from studying
English. This included reading quickly, writing well, thinking critically and creatively,
communicating effectively and empathetically, and more. Once I made that list in my head, I
knew I was a hirable, promotable force, no matter what my diploma said.

## Four Tips for Landing the Gig

There is an innate pressure in American society to get the right education to land the perfect job
to find success, but the reality of getting hired and making big bucks is not linear. There are so
many factors at play when it comes to getting a job.

Here are my four biggest suggestions for landing the job of your dreams, no matter what your
degree is in.

### 1. Find out what your dream company’s most important hiring factor is and use that as leverage.

Some companies just want to see that you have a bachelor’s degree; others rely solely on soft
skills like effective communication, confidence, and the ability to be a part of a team. Some
companies only like to hire within the company. Other important factors are personal
connections, recommendations, a willingness to learn, a passion for the position or field, and —
perhaps most importantly — related experience. If you don’t already work for your dream
company, find out which factor is most important by reaching out to someone who works at the
company.

### 2. Don’t get bogged down by job descriptions.

I know this is hard to do, especially with the job descriptions that list particular degrees the position requires, or the hiring manager prefers. Don’t let it deter you from applying for the position. Just be sure to elaborate in your cover letter and interview on how your particular expertise and coursework make you the right candidate for the job. Did your degree in theology make you more empathic and open-minded? Did your chemistry degree make you detail-oriented and thorough? Did your theatre degree help you talk to anyone about anything? These are the skills you can play up in a professional setting.

### 3. Build up experience outside the classroom.

There will always be jobs with prerequisites and certain experiential requirements. While some candidates may have checked these boxes during undergrad, there’s no reason you can’t gain the same experiences as a young adult. Join a board, volunteer, take night classes, take online courses. In this day and age, there are a million opportunities for gaining experience after you earn a bachelor’s degree.

### 4. Network.

Listen, I hate walking up to someone and awkwardly talking about business outside of a business setting just as much as the next person, but there’s a reason everyone swears by it. Making personal connections gives you a leg up in nearly any situation. You can gain clients, learn about new opportunities, get hired, meet the love of your life, and more. And a great interpersonal relationship almost always carries more weight than a degree. It’s almost like a free, no-strings-attached interview. Nail this skill and you’ll be sailing smoothly.

At the end of the day, you really can be whatever you want to be. I’ve seen English majors go to medical school, join the military, become stay-at-home parents, go into banking, and more. I left my position recently and now do contract work as a freelance writer and content marketer.

Do the thing that brings you the most joy. And if that means reading all the books and writing all the papers in college, then do it. You may just need to balance it out with other prerequisites or experience if you plan to join a seemingly unrelated field. No matter what, go where no woman has gone before and make it happen for yourself!
