## Levo: What is it and What Can it do for You?

Levo is like LinkedIn’s fun sibling. Its platform is professional at heart, while emphasizing your personal flare. Relatable. Helpful. Attractive. It’s everything you didn’t know you wanted in a professional networking site. 

<hr class="secondary">

Levo wants to “showcase the real you.” Your profile prompts you to not list job responsibilities, but rather to explain why you love what you do. Instead of using a logo for a company photo, you’re free to post a picture of your adorable coworkers https://www.levo.com/skylar-wooden dressed as Alice in Wonderland characters. 

Choosing your colors and pictures is oddly reminiscent of building your MySpace profile, in only the best ways, of course. Levo gives you a space to be who you are, without throwing professionalism out the door.

### You’re More than Your Job Title

At times, we identify ourselves by our professions. Levo lets us identify by our lives in a well-rounded approach. You’re able to discuss your accomplishments alongside photos of your recent trip to Greece https://www.levo.com/945640, explaining how traveling has changed your perspective. 

You’re never just a CPA, or a Writer, or an Engineer. You’re so much more.
