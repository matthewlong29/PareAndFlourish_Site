If you haven’t been in this situation, let us assure you, it’s a specific kind of anxious hell. If you have, let us assure you that it happens, and it’s not the end of the world. Keep it together. 

Sending an invoice to a client who says they’ll pay “right away” is hard on the nerves when they don’t, in fact, pay right away. Day one, you’re a reasonable person with reasonable expectations. Day two, maybe they have a different idea of “right away.” Day three, they are not going to pay me, which means I’ll be short on bills, which means I could possibly die. Dramatic? Eh.  

Pro tip: Before you ever start a project, you need a deposit. It’s in your best interest to not even look at a project before you have a first payment. This can be a portion of the total cost (up to half) or, if it’s hourly, the first five hours of the project. Explain to the client that you charge a deposit upfront to protect your hours. If they protest, you do not want that client. 

## What To Do

First, calm yourself. Second, we’re going to share some feelings we’re sure you’ll relate to, and tell you how to get back on track. 

1. It’s been a week. How long should I wait?
2. It’s been two weeks. How rude. 
3. Are they not paying me because they don’t like my work?
4. Maybe I should just let it go. 

Let’s break these down. 

### 1. It’s been a week. How long should I wait?

A week is plenty of time for someone to pay an invoice, but depending on the client, they may feel like they have more time. Be sure that you’re marking your invoices “due [one week from the send date].” 

What you do: Send a polite reminder email. Let them know that their invoice is due, but you are open to extending it x amount of days, if need be. 

### 2. It’s been two weeks. How rude.

If you haven’t heard from them in two weeks, they’re pushing a boundary and it’s time to consider more action. 

What to do: Send an email informing them that they must pay the invoice, or else you will not be sending the final draft without a watermark [or whatever the final product of your service looks like].

### 3. Are they not paying me because they don’t like my work?

That’s probably not it. Even if it is, they owe you an email with constructive feedback so you can fix the problem. 

What to do: Include in the email that you would be happy to perform a round of edits for them if they let you know what to improve.


### 4. Maybe I should just let it go.

No no no no no. 

What to do: Any of the above. But no. No no no. Do not just let them not pay when you’ve spent hours of your life working on their project. 

If you have tried all of the above and are 100% sure they’re not going to pay you, take this as a lesson to take a deposit upfront and structure your sales to protect you. No matter how friendly the client may be.
