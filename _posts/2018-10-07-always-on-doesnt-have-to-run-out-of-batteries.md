Everything is “on” all the time. The lights, our computers, our phones, our minds. Our workload piles up while we sleep. Social media apps are on our phones, waiting for us to pick them up and overdose on information. We start our 8 am shifts with 40+ emails and end the day knowing our inboxes will be full again tomorrow. 
 
Our world is constantly moving and some of us are hardly sleeping because of it. Being “always on” is becoming a normal way of life. Moreover, it has nearly become a necessity to be successful in whatever you do.
 
But how do you keep going when you become tired of being always on? What do you do when the batteries run out?
 
Here are our four tips (plus our favorite go-to products) to help you stay “on” without wearing out.

## Give yourself time to boot up in the morning

This is our favorite tip: having a morning routine to **take care of yourself**. That means fighting the urge to immediately jump on social media, check your email, or hit that snooze button. 

>Alright, so you might have to wake up *before* five minutes until it’s time to leave. But we promise you’ll feel so much better than if you had slept in.

Drink a glass of water. Open the curtains and let in natural light. Massage your face with a refreshing moisturizer.

To stay “on” all day long, our bodies need that extra pick me up for positive energy throughout the day. Having a morning self-care routine, even if it means waking up ten minutes early, is *vital*.

## Be Present

  <p>How can we be present while always going, moving, and working? Fair point. But, what good is all that progress you’re making if you never stop to reflect?</p>
  <p>When things are feeling particularly insane and we haven’t focused on ourselves, we turn to mindfulness journals! <a href="https://amzn.to/2PbPB2F">Present Not Perfect</a>, in particular. It’s a great way to take five or ten minutes to examine ourselves and what makes us happy.</p>

## Create  Boundaries

We recently wrote about [how to set boundaries](/blog/knowing-when-to-set-a-boundary/), but if you’re overwhelmed, they’re easy to overlook. We forget that the goal is to make ourselves happy. So, if you’re always on, but always pleasing other people, you’ll easily run out of steam. By staying present and remembering those boundaries, you’ll be able to give your full potential.

## Relax Because of Your Schedule, Not in Spite of It

Stepping into the professional world, “let me check my calendar” becomes a popular phrase. Some live and die by what’s on their calendar. If you’re that person, why not schedule self-care activities, dinners with friends, and creative days? 

Have an hour on your lunch break? Take five minutes on your walk back to listen to a podcast or an audiobook. (A few of our favorites are listed [here][/blog/four-ways-to-get-most-out-of-your-commute/].) Doodle in your mindfulness journal and answer some questions while you have your mid-afternoon chocolate. (And if you’re not having mid-afternoon chocolate, let us know so we can write a post about why you should.)

Don’t have a mindfulness journal? Our favorite is [The Happiness Planner](https://thehappinessplanner.com/?aff=377). With daily gratitude sections, a happiness roadmap, and so much more, you can’t go wrong! It’s a journal dedicated to your happiness. Each daily page has a section to pencil in your schedule, a.k.a 9 A.M. meeting, lunch date with my mindfulness journal, 2 P.M. Dove dark chocolate bar.
