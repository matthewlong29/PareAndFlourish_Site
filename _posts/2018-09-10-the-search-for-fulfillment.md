We recently sat down with a few of Elizabethtown’s best women, wine, and donuts. Wine and donuts go together, right? 

We thought so. 

This [Flourish Roundtable](/event) was a full 2 hours devoted to meaningful networking. Our goal was to explore fulfillment as it fit into our lives and use that connection to bring everyone together. Thanks to the ladies who attended and participated in the discussion, we did just that. 

As the discussion flowed, it was clear that we all struggled with fulfillment in one way or another. Every woman at the table, no matter how different, could relate to the search for fulfillment. Some knew exactly how they wanted to get there, some were still on their search, and others were already at a place where they felt consistently fulfilled. 

It was also clear that we all feel fulfilled at one point or another, but maintaining that fulfillment is tricky.

We started with the definition of fulfillment.

“Fulfillment is the achievement of something desired, promised, or predicted.”

Once fulfillment was clearly defined, we went deeper. We intended to uncover what gave us that fulfilled feeling in the moment, what took away from it, and how intentional decisions help us maintain it. 

Here’s what we learned: 

## Life Isn’t Always Balanced

The discussion found its way to work-life balance. We found that the key to work-life balance is realizing it isn’t always balanced. Sometimes work is in the forefront, and other times your life gets to take priority. Learning to ride the waves and appreciate that your work-life balance ebbs and flows is vital. Some explained that they were able to achieve this by finding a work life that worked with their schedule, priorities, and values. Others were able to achieve this by melding their priorities.

## Society Sometimes Plays a Role in Fulfillment

Societal expectation can weigh heavy on our shoulders when it comes to finding fulfillment. At times, society seems to push you in a direction based on your age, gender, or phase of life. 

It’s important to not look to others to gage whether your life is on track. Your track will always look different than someone else’s and that’s one hundred percent okay. Motherhood may or may not fulfill you. It doesn’t mean you love your kids any less. You career may or may not fulfill you. It doesn’t mean you aren’t successful. 

Do what your intuition leads you to do. Live the way you want to live.

## It’s Important to Make Choices that Align with your Values

We wrapped up the conversation with a quick exercise. It allowed everyone to determine their values, and then to assess how their values aligned with past or upcoming decisions. When disagreements between values and decisions arose, it was often because the two conflicted.
