<p>This unique blog is written by two very different people, living very different lives.</p>

<p class="script">Skylar</p><p class="script-inline">, the creative one, the Writer.</p><br>
<p class="script">Katie</p><p class="script-inline">, the logical thinker, the Accountant.</p>

<p>For the sake of our partnership, we meld our ideas—every post is a product of our combined points of view...and a lot of editing.</p>

<p>If you’re curious about our blog writing process: On a shared Google Doc, Katie types out her ideas of the word-vomit persuasion without regard to coherent English. After staring at the mess of words, Skylar uses that extremely expensive English degree to mold the chaos into what you’ll see throughout the blog. We think we’re funny. That may not be true. It’s up to you, really.</p>

<p>In Introduction to Pare and Flourish and Authenticity: What it Means to You, we briefly describe what this blog is all about. If you haven’t gotten there yet, this is a personal development blog focused on living an authentic lifestyle. While the definition an “authentic lifestyle” is subjective, we personally define it as living mindfully and being true to ourselves.</p>

<p>If you enjoy books like Lean In, Yes Please, and Bossypants, or podcasts like Millennial and The Lively Show, we think that you’ll feel right at home here. After all, they inspired this blog and gave us the courage to finally put it together.</p>

<p>We dedicate our time to this blog to inspire and encourage our readers to grow personally and professionally. It is our hope that we add authenticity to your week. Topics will range from networking, to self care, to our favorite books, and everything in between.</p>

<p>Blog posts don’t necessarily have to be read in any particular order, though it wouldn’t hurt. Feel free to pick and choose what we have that’s relevant to your life. Also, check out our bonus material, which will include our recommendations, maybe some how-tos, and anything else that we’re excited to share with you.</p>
